    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep your pan & bread. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or tinfoil, slice your bread in half lengthwise, 
            and place the bread cut side up on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Make the garlic butter. In a small bowl mix the herbs and salt together with the softened butter. Spread it evenly over the top of the bread halves.</li>
        <li>Bake & serve. Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes at 425 degrees F until it’s slightly golden brown on the edges. If you’re adding cheese, add it in the last 2 minutes of baking. Then cool, slice into 1-inch pieces, and devour!</li>
    </ol>
