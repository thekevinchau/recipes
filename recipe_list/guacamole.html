        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the <strong>best guacamole recipe</strong> as it’s simple to make and uses fresh, high-quality ingredients. <strong>Authentic guacamole</strong> doesn’t contain fillers and unnecessary ingredients.
             All you need is avocados, onion, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, lime juice, garlic, and salt. Easy and delicious!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Avocados</strong>: I’ve got a few tips for picking ripe ones below.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onions</strong>: I’m using yellow onion which is most often used in Mexico, but you could use red onion as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tomato</strong>: Choose Roma tomatoes which are less juicy. No one wants a watery guac.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cilantro</strong>: One of my favorite herbs and a staple in Mexican cuisine.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Jalapeno</strong>: You can also use serrano pepper for a little extra heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Garlic</strong>: Some people like their guac with garlic, others like it without. I love just a little.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lime</strong>:  Freshly squeezed lime is a must. Don’t use jarred lime juice as the flavor is muted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of flakey salt brings it all together.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice three ripe avocados in half, remove the pit and scoop them into a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Then use a fork to gently mash them to your desired level of chunky or smooth</li>
            <li>Add the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, garlic, lime juice and salt</li>
            <li>Stir everything together.</li>
        </ol>
