        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Alfredo Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the noodles</strong>: Cook the Fettuccine al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the chicken</strong>: Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce</strong>: Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble</strong>: Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
        </ol>
